/* Kata 1 - Easy

  Welcome to the breakfast cafe! 
  We're taking breakfast orders; work out how many eggs the kitchen will need for each order.

  * for scrambled eggs, you’ll need 2 eggs
  * for an omelette you’ll need 3 eggs
  * for a fried egg, you’ll need 1 egg
  * IMPORTANT: if an order contains over 25 eggs, you must return "Oh no, we've run out of eggs! Please order something else."

  For example, the following order should require 8 eggs:
  [”scrambled egg”, “bacon”, “fried egg”, “toast”, “scrambled egg”, “omelette”]

/* Kata 2 - Less Easy

  It's time to pay the bill - but everyone only wants to pay for what they had! 

  You'll be given a full table's bill as an array of objects containing individual customers' orders (see example below).
  Each individual order will have a max of one main, one drink and one extra each, with the following prices:

  Mains
  * "full english" - £12.50
  * "vegan breakfast" - £11
  * "eggs royale" £9 

  Extras
  * "pain au chocolat" £2.50
  * "toast" £1.50

  Drinks
  * "coffee" £3
  * "tea" £2

  * IMPORTANT: if a customer has ordered a main meal, their drink will be free and shouldn't be included in their final order price!

  Return an array, where each item is the total price each customer owes for their breakfast.

  Example:
      Table Order: ([{main: "full english", drink: "coffee"}, {main: "full english", drink: "tea"}, {main: "coffee", extras: "toast"}])
      Should return: ([12.5, 12.5, 4.5])
