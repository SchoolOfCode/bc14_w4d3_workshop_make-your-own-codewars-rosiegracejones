/* 
Welcome to the breakfast cafe! 

We're taking breakfast orders; it’s your job to work out how many eggs the kitchen will need for each order.

* for scrambled eggs, you’ll need 2 eggs
* for an omelette you’ll need 3 eggs
* for a fried egg, you’ll need 1 egg
* you shouldn't count any other breakfast items.
* IMPORTANT: if an order contains over 25 eggs, you must return "Oh no, we've run out of eggs! Please order something else."

For example, the following order should require 8 eggs:
[”scrambled egg”, “bacon”, “fried egg”, “toast”, “scrambled egg”, “omelette”]

// Here's your starter code:

export function eggCount(breakfastOrder) {
